<h1>nodeJs-playground</h1>

<p>This is my nodeJS playground<br>
Learning about nodeJS, Express, REST APIs, and Mongoose driver to access mongoDB in nodeJS app

Note: I ignored a "nodemon.json" file as it contained my Mongodb Atlas user & password
it had this form inside:
```json
{
    "env": {
        "MONGO_ATLAS_user": "your ATLAS project username",
        "MONGO_ATLAS_PW": "your ATLAS project password"
    }
}
```
Note: I ignored uploads/ folder but it's created automatically once a user uploads an image.
